# Settings

Nth Grid only has 3 variables you can configure. These variables set the default behaviour of the mixins, but they can be changed when using the mixins anyway.
Simply declare them in your project with your own values to overwrite the defaults.

```scss
$nth-grid: 3;

/// Default grid gutter
$grid-gutter: 1rem;

/// Default grid selector
$grid-selector: '>';
```
